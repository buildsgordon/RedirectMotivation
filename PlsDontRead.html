  <h1 id="no-scroll-heading" style="margin:0 0 0.5rem;font-size:1.8rem;letter-spacing:-0.5px;">Stop scrolling. Stop wasting your life.</h1>

  <p style="margin:0 0 1rem;font-size:1rem;">
    What the hell are you doing? You already know it’s stupid, yet you keep throwing away the only resource you’ll <strong>never</strong> get back—time.
  </p>

  <p style="margin:0 0 1rem;font-size:1rem;">
    Look around. People who had less than you, people who started with nothing, are outworking you every single day. They don’t have your comforts, your excuses, or your distractions. They’re building while you rot in front of a screen.
  </p>

  <p style="margin:0 0 1rem;font-size:1rem;">
    Every wasted hour makes you weaker. Every "easy" choice is actually a vote for a harder life: regret, mediocrity, and being forgotten. You will grow old with nothing to show unless you change now.
  </p>

  <p style="margin:0 0 1rem;font-size:1rem;">
    Want to matter? Then act like it.
  </p>

  <ul style="margin:0 0 1.25rem 1.25rem;padding:0;font-size:1rem;">
    <li><strong>Work now.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Finish fast.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Push harder</strong> than you think you can.</li>
    <li><strong>Build yourself</strong> into someone worth respecting.</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="margin:0 0 1rem;font-size:1rem;">
    When you’re bored, don’t run back to mindless scrolling like a coward. Read. Learn. Train. Meditate. Solve problems. Do anything that makes you stronger.
  </p>

  <p style="margin:0;font-size:1rem;color:#ffdddd;">
    You don’t deserve greatness if you can’t even fight your own laziness.
